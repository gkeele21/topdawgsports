                    <h1>College Love Em & Leave Em Rules</h1>

                    <h3>Game Play</h3>
                    <p>The game is played by selecting 2 College teams each week that you think is going to win. Sound easy enough? Go ahead and pick the powerhouses that have a cupcake win. Just know, that you won't be able to pick any of those teams again. You can love a team one time but then you have to leave them for the rest of the year. The games listed each week will only be those that include a team in the Top 25 of the BCS Standings.  When the BCS Standings are not available, the AP Poll will be used. Since the Top 25 changes after each week, you will only be able to select your teams on a week by week basis. Games will be ready to pick shortly after the new rankings come out each week. You can pick a team that is not in the top 25 but only the games that has a team in the top 25 will be available.</p>

                    <h3>Season Duration</h3>
                    <p>The season will last all the way through the entire regular season including the conference championship games.  It will not include any Bowl games.</p>

                    <h3>Entry Fee</h3>
                    <p>This game costs $3 per entry per person (General League only).</p>

                    <h3>Player Limit</h3>
                    <p>This game can have an unlimited amount of players.</p>

                    <h3>Scoring</h3>
                    <p>You receive 1 point for each game that you correctly pick the winner.</p>

                    <h3>Important Note</h3>
                    <p>This game might be similar to ones that you have played before but it is different in that if you make an incorrect pick, you are not out of the game and done for the year.  You continue to make picks throughout the whole year and the winner is determined by the total # correct, not the person that lasted the longest without ever missing.</p>

                    <h3>Champion</h3>
                    <p>The team(s) with the most accumulated points at the conclusion of the regular season.</p>

                    <h3>Tiebreaker</h3>
                    <p>There is no tiebreaker, the prizes will be split equally among all tied winners.</p>

                    <h3>Grand Prize</h3>
                    <p>Winner takes all. The champion(s) will receive a prize worth up to the total amount of all entry fees.</p>
